# Octave Machine Learning Library

This library contains implementations of basic machine learning techniques
like linear and logistic regression contained in `simple_ml`, to more advanced
techniques convolutional nets and RICA feature learning contained in
`advanced_ml`.

`simple_ml` code adapted from the [Coursera Machine Learning][coursera_ml] and
`advanced_ml` the latter was adapted from the
[Stanford Deep Learning][standord_dl] tutorial starter code.

# Environment Setup

Depending on your OS, follow the instructions [here][octave_setup] to install
Octave.
